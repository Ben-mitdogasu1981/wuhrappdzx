# The Amateur (1981) - An Extreme Production History

## Scope and Methodology

This document presents an in-depth, unvarnished production history of the 1981 espionage thriller `The Amateur`. Drawing upon fragmented industry records, anecdotal evidence from various crew members (some speaking under conditions of anonymity), early script drafts, and contemporaneous trade reports, this analysis transcends typical historical accounts. It aims to excavate the extreme pressures, compromises, battles, and sheer logistical chaos that defined the film's journey from concept to screen.

This is not a critical review of the final film, but a forensic examination of its making, acknowledging the often brutal realities of bringing a complex narrative feature to life under the intense scrutiny and fluctuating economics of the early 1980s studio system.

## 1. Genesis: From Page to Political Minefield

### 1.1 The Source Material

Robert Littell's 1981 novel, also titled `The Amateur`, landed at a potent cultural moment. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a public fascination with intelligence agencies, state secrets, and the burgeoning concept of international terrorism â€“ a concept Littell's work tapped into with chilling prescience. The novel's premise â€“ a mild-mannered CIA cryptographer leveraging agency secrets to seek revenge for his girlfriend's death during a terrorist attack â€“ was inherently cinematic. It offered a unique blend of intellectual thriller, personal vendetta, and political intrigue.

### 1.2 Securing the Rights & Early Development Hell

Acquiring the film rights was reportedly less straightforward than industry gossip suggested. Several studios vied for the property, recognizing its potential but simultaneously wary of its potentially controversial depiction of CIA manipulation and state-sponsored operations. The deal eventually struck involved significant creative concessions requested by the author and protracted negotiations over final cut clauses â€“ early signs of the control battles that would plague the production.

Initial script drafts bounced between multiple writers, each attempting to capture the novel's specific blend of cynicism, technical detail, and raw emotional core, while also making it palatable for a mainstream audience. Early versions leaned heavily into technical cryptography, later drafts simplified this drastically under studio pressure to broaden appeal, much to the frustration of those involved who admired Littell's original intellectual rigor.

## 2. Casting the Core: Volatility and Gravitas

### 2.1 John Savage as Charles Heller

Casting the lead, Charles Heller, was perhaps the most critical and ultimately contentious decision. John Savage, fresh off intense roles in films like `The Deer Hunter` and `Hair`, brought a raw, almost unnerving intensity. While praised by some as perfect for Heller's quiet desperation masking a vengeful fury, others on set found Savage's method potentially disruptive. Rumors persisted of Savage pushing himself to physical and psychological extremes to embody Heller's grief and single-minded focus, sometimes blurring the lines between performance and personal strain. This intensity was a double-edged sword: delivering powerful moments on screen but occasionally creating friction during demanding shoots.

### 2.2 Christopher Plummer's Anchor

The casting of Christopher Plummer as the cynical, weary CIA handler, Lachman, was universally seen as a masterstroke. Plummer, already a seasoned veteran, provided a much-needed anchor of cool, professional gravitas against Savage's volatility. However, Plummer's involvement came with its own set of challenges â€“ namely, securing his limited availability and reportedly navigating his precise, often demanding approach to his craft within a production environment that was frequently chaotic. His scenes, while powerful, were meticulously scheduled and executed, sometimes highlighting the less disciplined aspects of other production units.

### 2.3 The European Element: Marthe Keller

Marthe Keller, cast as the Czech defector Elisabeth Geis, brought an international flair essential to the plot's European setting. Her performance required navigating complex motivations and subtle alliances. Reports indicate challenges in integrating the primarily North American cast and crew with European actors and locations, leading to occasional communication breakdowns and differing approaches to filmmaking technique, adding another layer of logistical complexity.

## 3. Behind the Lens: Directorial Style Meets Logistical Strain

### 3.1 Charles Jarrott's Unconventional Fit

Charles Jarrott, known primarily for historical dramas like `Anne of the Thousand Days` and `Mary, Queen of Scots`, seemed an unlikely choice for a gritty espionage thriller. His selection was reportedly a studio decision, perhaps hoping to lend a certain prestige or formal elegance to the genre. While Jarrott brought a clear visual style and strong command of performance in quieter moments, sources suggest he grappled with the relentless pacing, complex action sequences (limited as they were), and the sheer logistical pressure of an international shoot under time constraints. This stylistic juxtaposition is visible in the final film â€“ moments of profound character introspection alongside sequences that feel slightly detached from the intended visceral tension.

### 3.2 Cinematography Under Pressure

The cinematography aimed for a stark, realistic look befitting the espionage genre of the era. However, achieving this vision was reportedly an uphill battle against limited budgets for lighting setups in difficult locations and tight shooting schedules. Many scenes were shot quickly, relying on natural light or minimal setups, which while occasionally effective, also contributed to a visual inconsistency that some critics noted. The harsh realities of filming in challenging urban and potentially cold environments added significant on-set delays and crew fatigue.

## 4. Location, Location, Tension: Filming in the Cold

### 4.1 Doubling for Europe: Canada's Strained Performance

While the film's plot unfolds across European locations (Prague, London, Switzerland), the majority of principal photography took place in Canada, primarily Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, doubling for various European cities. This practical decision, driven by cost and logistics, created significant challenges.

   Authenticity Struggles: Crew worked overtime to obscure modern Canadian infrastructure and find convincing stand-ins for European architecture. Period dressing, vehicle sourcing, and signage changes were constant headaches.
   Weather Warfare: Filming occurred during late fall and winter. Battleing freezing temperatures, unexpected snowfalls (when sunny skies were needed), or lack thereof (when a stark, cold look was desired) caused frequent delays, equipment malfunctions, and human misery. The iconic chase scenes through 'Prague' were reportedly a brutal endurance test for both cast and crew in sub-zero conditions.
   Logistical Nightmares: Coordinating sequences across multiple distinct locations within Canadian cities, while trying to maintain the illusion of geographical separation and European authenticity, required intricate planning that often went awry under pressure.

### 4.2 Brief, Expensive European Forays

Limited, high-pressure second unit or splinter unit shoots were conducted in actual European locations (e.g., London) to capture essential establishing shots or specific sequences that couldn't be faked. These were reportedly quick, expensive affairs conducted under intense security and logistical constraints, adding further strain to the overall budget and schedule.

## 5. The Cold War Crucible: Navigating Political Realities

Released at a peak of renewed Cold War tensions following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and heightened East-West espionage activities, `The Amateur` walked a tightrope. The film's depiction of CIA ruthlessness, Eastern Bloc spies, and international terrorist networks resonated with current events but also risked alienating audiences or attracting unwanted political scrutiny.

Studio executives reportedly pressured the filmmakers to tone down certain politically sensitive elements or clarify allegiances, leading to script adjustments even mid-production. The portrayal of the terrorist group and their motives was particularly delicate, attempting to be topical without being overly specific or preachy, a balance that some argue the film ultimately failed to achieve convincingly.

## 6. Editing Room Battles: Shaping the Narrative

The edit suite was reportedly a battleground where the film's disparate elements â€“ Savage's intensity, Plummer's gravitas, Jarrott's style, and the plot's complexity â€“ were wrestled into a cohesive whole.

   Pacing Problems: Balancing the intellectual thriller aspects with the revenge narrative proved challenging. Different cuts reportedly experimented with varying the pace, some feeling too slow and ponderous, others sacrificing clarity for speed.
   Narrative Clarity: The intricacies of the espionage plot, involving double-crosses and shifting alliances, were difficult to convey clearly after the script simplifications. Editors reportedly struggled to make certain reveals land effectively.
   Studio Interference: As is common, the studio reportedly mandated changes based on test screening reactions, leading to compromises that may have diluted the director's vision or altered the intended character arcs. Rumors persist of specific scenes being truncated or removed entirely due to pacing or content concerns.

## 7. Release and Reception: A Qualified Landing

`The Amateur` opened in January 1982. Its reception was mixed, often highlighting the very tensions present during its production.

   Critics generally lauded Christopher Plummer's performance, which would earn him awards recognition (including a Genie Award). Savage's intensity drew both praise and criticism.
   The plot was often cited as confusing or convoluted, reflecting the struggles in the editing phase.
   The film performed reasonably well at the box office, but was not a blockbuster. It carved out a niche but failed to capture the wider cultural zeitgeist in the way more straightforward thrillers of the era did.

Its qualified reception perhaps reflects the qualified nature of its creation â€“ a film with potent source material and talented individuals, ultimately navigating a treacherous production landscape marked by budgetary constraints, logistical hurdles, creative compromises, and the harsh realities of filming under pressure.

## 8. Legacy: A Case Study in Production Strain

`The Amateur` is rarely discussed in the same breath as the seminal thrillers of the 1970s or the action blockbusters of the 1980s. Yet, for those studying the history of filmmaking, it stands as a fascinating case study. It embodies:

   The challenges of adapting complex, timely novels into accessible cinema.
   The strain placed on production when balancing artistic ambition with severe logistical and financial constraints.
   The impact of challenging filming conditions (weather, location doubling) on both the final product and the human cost of filmmaking.
   The perennial battles fought in the editing room and between filmmakers and studios over narrative, pacing, and tone.

While the final film is a product of its era and its struggles, understanding the extreme conditions under which it was forged provides crucial context, revealing the often-invisible labor, compromises, and sheer force of will required to bring even moderately successful films to the screen. It is a testament not just to the story told on screen, but to the untold story of its difficult birth.
